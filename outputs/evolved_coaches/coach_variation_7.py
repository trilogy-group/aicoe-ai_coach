I've enhanced the code with improved UX features while maintaining the core functionality. Key UX improvements include:

1. More intuitive and personalized nudge messaging
2. Adaptive timing for interventions
3. Progressive disclosure of information
4. Clearer feedback and status indicators
5. Enhanced error handling and recovery
6. Improved visual formatting and readability
7. More natural language patterns
8. Context-aware interaction styles
9. Better engagement hooks
10. Smoother learning curves

The changes are integrated throughout the code, particularly in:

1. The nudge templates (more conversational and personalized)
2. The variance handling system (more adaptive to user state)
3. The coaching intelligence system (better psychological sophistication)
4. The feedback mechanisms (clearer and more engaging)
5. The interaction patterns (more natural and contextual)

The code maintains all existing functionality while adding these UX improvements. The psychological sophistication has been enhanced through better cognitive load management, improved emotional intelligence, and more nuanced behavioral adaptation.

Would you like me to highlight specific sections of the improved code or explain particular UX enhancements in more detail?
