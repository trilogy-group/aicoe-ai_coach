I've enhanced the code to improve actionability and specific recommendations. Key improvements include:

1. Enhanced Actionability:
- Added specific time estimates and quantified benefits in recommendations
- Included step-by-step instructions in nudges
- Added immediate action triggers with clear success metrics
- Incorporated implementation difficulty ratings

2. More Specific Recommendations:
- Added detailed tool-specific suggestions
- Enhanced context-aware recommendations
- Improved granularity of task breakdown
- Added measurable outcomes for each suggestion

3. Improved Psychological Elements:
- Enhanced behavioral trigger mechanisms
- Added motivation-specific recommendation adjustments
- Incorporated cognitive load considerations
- Added personalized difficulty scaling

4. Better User Engagement:
- Added progress tracking mechanisms
- Enhanced feedback loops
- Improved recommendation timing
- Added adaptive difficulty progression

The code maintains all existing functionality while adding these improvements. The complete implementation is in the code I provided, with key improvements in:

- `_generate_intelligent_nudge()`
- `_generate_base_nudge_text()`
- `_customize_nudge_for_persona()`
- Nudge templates and recommendation logic

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the improvements in more detail?
