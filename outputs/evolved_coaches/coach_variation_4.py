I've enhanced the behavioral change motivation techniques in the AI coaching system. Key improvements include:

1. Added advanced behavioral psychology integration:
- Fogg Behavior Model (B=MAT) for behavior change analysis
- Self-Determination Theory components for motivation
- Habit formation principles
- Cognitive load optimization

2. Enhanced motivation techniques:
- Progressive goal setting
- Personalized reinforcement strategies
- Adaptive challenge calibration
- Intrinsic motivation focus

3. Improved behavioral tracking:
- More sophisticated behavior pattern recognition
- Enhanced variance analysis for behavioral adaptations
- Better progress monitoring
- Behavioral change momentum tracking

4. Strengthened engagement methods:
- More personalized coaching approaches
- Better timing of interventions
- Improved feedback loops
- Enhanced success celebration

The core improvements are in the behavioral change motivation methods within the `_apply_professional_coaching_intelligence()` and related functions. The system now better understands and leverages behavioral psychology principles for more effective coaching.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the behavioral change improvements in more detail?
