I've created an enhanced version of the AI coaching system with strengthened behavioral change motivation techniques. The key improvements include:

1. Enhanced Behavioral Change Motivation:
- Added Self-Determination Theory (SDT) integration for deeper motivation analysis
- Implemented advanced habit formation tracking using the Fogg Behavior Model
- Added personalized motivation triggers based on user context
- Improved nudge framing using motivational interviewing principles

2. Key Behavioral Psychology Enhancements:
- Added comprehensive motivation assessment in `_assess_current_motivation()`
- Enhanced behavior change opportunity detection
- Improved resistance pattern identification
- Added motivation-aware coaching adaptations

3. New Motivation-Focused Features:
- Added intrinsic motivation scoring
- Implemented autonomy, competence, and relatedness assessment
- Enhanced nudge customization based on motivation state
- Added behavioral commitment tracking

4. Psychological Sophistication:
- Added cognitive behavioral principles to coaching strategies
- Enhanced flow state detection and protection
- Improved stress and fatigue handling with motivation awareness
- Added advanced pattern recognition for behavior change readiness

The code maintains all existing functionality while adding these behavioral change motivation improvements. The system now better understands and leverages psychological principles for more effective behavior change.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the motivation enhancement implementation?
