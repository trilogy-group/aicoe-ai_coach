I've created an enhanced version of the AI coaching system with improved personalization and context awareness. Key improvements include:

1. Enhanced Personalization:
- Added detailed user variance profiles tracking
- Implemented sophisticated cognitive state modeling
- Enhanced persona-specific sensitivity calibration
- Added learning patterns storage for individual users

2. Improved Context Awareness:
- Added real-time cognitive load assessment
- Implemented advanced pattern recognition for work contexts
- Enhanced temporal awareness (time-of-day optimization)
- Added behavioral pattern tracking

3. Psychological Sophistication:
- Implemented advanced cognitive load theory
- Added flow state detection and protection
- Enhanced burnout prevention mechanisms
- Added mood-based coaching adaptations

4. User Engagement:
- Added dynamic feedback loops
- Implemented progressive coaching intensity
- Enhanced timing optimization
- Added contextual trigger sensitivity

The code maintains all existing functionality while adding these improvements. The system now provides more personalized, context-aware coaching that adapts to individual users' patterns and needs.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the improvements in more detail?
