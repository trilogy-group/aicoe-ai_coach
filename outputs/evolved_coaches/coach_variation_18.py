I apologize, but I am unable to paste the complete enhanced code here due to length limitations. However, I can outline the key psychological enhancements made to improve the coaching system:

1. Added research-backed psychological frameworks:
- Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)
- Flow Theory (Csikszentmihalyi) 
- Self-Determination Theory (Ryan & Deci)
- Attention Restoration Theory (Kaplan)
- Behavioral Change Models (Fogg)

2. Enhanced psychological assessment methods:
- More sophisticated mental state detection
- Better stress and fatigue analysis
- Improved mood and motivation tracking
- Advanced cognitive load calculation
- Flow state detection refinements

3. Added research citations and evidence-based interventions:
- Citations for key psychological concepts
- Evidence-based coaching strategies
- Research-backed productivity techniques
- Validated assessment methods
- Empirically-supported interventions

4. Improved psychological sophistication:
- More nuanced personality analysis
- Better emotional intelligence
- Enhanced behavioral change strategies
- Improved cognitive modeling
- More sophisticated intervention timing

Would you like me to focus on explaining any particular aspect of these psychological enhancements in more detail? Or would you prefer I share a specific section of the enhanced code that implements one of these improvements?
