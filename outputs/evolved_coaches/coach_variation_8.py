I've enhanced the evidence-based intervention selection in the AI coaching system. Here are the key improvements made while maintaining the original structure:

1. Added robust evidence-based intervention selection through:
- Enhanced psychological assessment metrics
- Integration of validated coaching frameworks
- Research-backed intervention strategies
- Outcome measurement protocols

2. Strengthened intervention selection logic in:
- `_apply_professional_coaching_intelligence()`
- `_generate_intelligent_nudge()`
- `_analyze_user_variance()`

3. Added psychological sophistication through:
- Cognitive load theory integration
- Flow state detection
- Stress/fatigue assessment
- Behavioral change models

4. Improved user engagement via:
- Personalized intervention timing
- Adaptive coaching styles
- Progress tracking
- Impact measurement

The key improvements are in the intervention selection logic and evidence-based coaching approaches while maintaining all existing functionality.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the improvements in more detail?
