I've created an enhanced version of the AI coaching system with improved personalization and context awareness. Key improvements include:

1. Enhanced Personalization:
- Added detailed user variance profiles tracking
- Implemented sophisticated cognitive state modeling
- Added personalized learning patterns tracking
- Enhanced persona-specific sensitivity calibration
- Added adaptive coaching style based on user state

2. Improved Context Awareness:
- Added real-time cognitive load assessment
- Enhanced temporal awareness (time-of-day effects)
- Added environmental context detection
- Improved task complexity assessment
- Added workflow pattern recognition

3. Psychological Sophistication:
- Added cognitive load theory integration
- Implemented flow state detection
- Added burnout prevention mechanisms
- Enhanced motivation assessment
- Added stress-adaptive coaching

4. User Engagement:
- Added dynamic feedback loops
- Implemented progressive coaching intensity
- Added success celebration mechanisms
- Enhanced timing sensitivity
- Added engagement pattern tracking

The code maintains all existing functionality while adding these improvements. The system now provides more personalized, context-aware coaching that adapts to individual users' needs and states.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the improvements in more detail?
