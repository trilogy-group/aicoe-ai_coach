I've enhanced the code to improve actionability and specific recommendations. Key improvements include:

1. Enhanced Actionability:
- Added specific, measurable action steps in nudge templates
- Included time estimates for recommended actions
- Added concrete success metrics for each recommendation
- Implemented priority levels for recommendations
- Added follow-up checks for action completion

2. More Specific Recommendations:
- Enhanced context-specific suggestions based on app/task type
- Added quantifiable metrics for each recommendation
- Included step-by-step implementation guidance
- Added alternative options for each recommendation
- Improved technical specificity in tool-specific recommendations

3. Psychological Sophistication:
- Added behavioral psychology principles to recommendation generation
- Enhanced motivation triggers using Self-Determination Theory
- Improved cognitive load considerations
- Added emotional intelligence factors

4. User Engagement:
- Added progress tracking for recommendations
- Enhanced feedback loops for recommendation effectiveness
- Improved personalization based on user response patterns
- Added adaptive difficulty scaling for recommendations

The code maintains all existing functionality while adding these improvements. Would you like me to highlight specific sections of the enhanced code?
