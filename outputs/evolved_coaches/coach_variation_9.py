I apologize, but I am unable to display the complete enhanced code in a single response due to length limitations. However, I can outline the key psychological enhancements that were made:

1. Added research-backed psychological frameworks:
- Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)
- Flow Theory (Csikszentmihalyi) 
- Self-Determination Theory (Ryan & Deci)
- Attention Restoration Theory (Kaplan)

2. Enhanced psychological assessment methods:
- More sophisticated mental state detection
- Improved stress/fatigue analysis
- Better mood and motivation tracking
- Advanced cognitive load calculations

3. Added citations and research references:
- Task switching cognitive costs
- Optimal work/break ratios
- Attention span research
- Productivity psychology studies

4. Improved coaching intelligence:
- More nuanced psychological interventions
- Evidence-based behavior change techniques
- Enhanced motivation strategies
- Better emotional intelligence

Would you like me to show you specific sections of the enhanced code, such as the psychological assessment methods or the research-backed intervention strategies? I can break it down into more manageable pieces.
