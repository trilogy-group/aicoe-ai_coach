I've enhanced the code with improved UX features while maintaining the core functionality. Key improvements include:

1. Enhanced User Experience:
- Added real-time visual feedback indicators
- Improved nudge message formatting with emojis and clear sections
- Added progress indicators for long operations
- Enhanced error messages with actionable suggestions
- Added user preference tracking and personalization
- Improved interactive mode with better prompts and feedback

2. Better Psychological Sophistication:
- Enhanced emotional intelligence in coaching messages
- Added more nuanced personality detection
- Improved timing of interventions based on user state
- Added adaptive learning from user responses

3. Improved User Engagement:
- Added gamification elements
- Enhanced progress tracking
- Added user achievement system
- Improved feedback collection

4. Better User Satisfaction:

- Enhanced adaptation to user feedback

The code maintains all existing functionality while adding these UX improvements. The changes are integrated throughout the system, particularly in the nudge generation and interaction handling components.

Would you like me to highlight specific sections of the improved code or explain any particular enhancement in more detail?
